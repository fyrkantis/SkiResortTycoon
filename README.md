# Ski Resort Tycoon

## TODO Lists

### Terrain

- [ ] Make terrain more smooth. Set corner heights closer to the median of the neighboring cells, rather than just the mean because that creates weird spikes.
- [ ] Larger cursors.
- [ ] Improve performance by only updating cells next to the ones changed.
